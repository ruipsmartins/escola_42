# School 42 Assignments

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my completed and ongoing assignments from School 42! ðŸŽ“ Here, you'll find a collection of projects and tasks that I've worked on as part of my journey at School 42.

## About School 42

[School 42](https://www.42.fr/) is a unique coding school that promotes a hands-on and peer-to-peer learning approach. The curriculum is designed to encourage independent problem-solving and collaboration among students. Each project is carefully crafted to challenge and develop various programming skills.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized to showcase the different assignments I've completed and the ones I'm currently working on. You'll find subdirectories for each assignment, containing the relevant source code, documentation, and any additional resources.

Feel free to explore and learn from my work. While I encourage you to use these projects to enhance your own coding skills, please respect the academic integrity of the assignments and avoid direct copying if you're a fellow School 42 student.

If you have any questions, feedback, or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. You can find my contact information in the repository or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rui-martins-864a7092).
