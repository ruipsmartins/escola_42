# Module Exercises: Rules and Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for completing the exercises in this module. Adherence to these instructions is mandatory to ensure consistent and high-quality submissions.

## Module-Specific Rules

### Standard Containers Usage

- **Mandatory**: Use standard containers from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) to complete each exercise.
- **Single Use Rule**: Once a container is used for an exercise, it cannot be reused in subsequent exercises.
- **Dual Container Requirement**: Exercise 02 requires the use of two containers.
- **Appropriate Selection**: Ensure that you select the appropriate container for each exercise after carefully evaluating the task requirements.

### Preliminary Reading

- It is advisable to read the entire subject document before starting the exercises. This will provide clarity and help in strategic planning for container selection.

### Makefile Requirements

- You must provide a Makefile for each program.
- The Makefile should:
  - Compile your source files into the required output.
  - Use the following compiler flags:
    - `-Wall`
    - `-Wextra`
    - `-Werror`
  - Ensure no unnecessary relinking occurs.
- **Mandatory Makefile Rules**:
  - `$(NAME)`
  - `all`
  - `clean`
  - `fclean`
  - `re`

### Language Requirement

- All programs must be written in C++.
